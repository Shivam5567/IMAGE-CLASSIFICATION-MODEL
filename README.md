MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH 

DESCRIPTION:
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **PyTorch** for image classification.  
It demonstrates the full deep learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model creation, training, and performance evaluation.
The example uses the **CIFAR-10** dataset (10 classes of natural images).  
You can replace it with MNIST or your own dataset by modifying the data loading section.

Features
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers
- Training with Adam optimizer and CrossEntropy loss
- Accuracy evaluation on the test dataset
- Confusion matrix visualization
